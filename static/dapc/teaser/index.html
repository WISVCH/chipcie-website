							Professor Cesium has created a new process to transform some chemical product into another type of chemical with some residues. The process is simple: he just
							needs to input a given number of molecules of type A,
							enter the output type B he desires and start the machine. It will create as many molecules
							of type B as possible. Unfortunately, professor Cadmium was jealous of his work and tried
							to sabotage the machine by inverting wires on his machine. Professor Cesium, alerted by one
							of his assistants, was able to repair the mistake. To detect any problem in the future, he is
							asking you to create an automatic way to compute the number of molecules that the machine
							should output. With this algorithm, he will be able to detect whether his precious machine
							was tampered with.
							<br><br>
							Molecules are written as string composed of upper case letters and numbers. Upper case letters
							represent atoms. Note that Cesium only uses single letters of the alphabet as abbreviations
							for atoms, so H, C, A, X, Y, ... can be used but He, Mg, ... can not. If a letter is not
							followed by a number, it means there is only one atom of it. An atom followed by a number l
							(1 â‰¤ l &#60 103) represents l copies of that atom. Atoms can appear multiple times in a chemical
							product.
							<br><br>
							For example: H2OC100H means 2 atoms of H, then 1 of O, then 100 of C then 1 of H again

						<h2>Input</h2>
						<ul>
							<li> Multiple cases of molecules with one input and one output. The first line specifies the number of 
								cases, every subsequent two lines are one case. The first line of a case specifies the input molecule 
								with a number for quantity, the second line specifies the output molecule.
						</ul>
						<h2>Output</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>The output consists of a single line of comma-seperated values indicating for each
								case the number of output molecules that can be produced from the input.
						</ul>
						<h2>Samples</h2>
