Also in 2022, the CHipCie will organise the Delft Algorithm Programming Contest (DAPC). This event is free for all TU Delft

The contest will take place on Saturday the 24th of September 2022. The program will be posted here on a later date.

Registration is done in the ICPC registration system, where all team members will need to make an account to sign up for the event.
