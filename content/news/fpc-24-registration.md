Are you a freshman and do you want to solve puzzles in a team with your friends? Then the Freshmen Programming Contest is for you!

On the 4th of May, the annual Freshmen Programming Contest will be held. The puzzles are suited for both beginners and experts, so don't be afraid to join! This contest is a great opportunity for you to sharpen your programming and puzzling skills!

The event lasts approximately from 10:00 until 18:00. More details will be shared with you in advance of the contest. Teams with non-freshmen members are able to join as space allows, but will be assigned to the spectator pool, meaning they do not count towards the final ranking.

Please fill in the [registration form](https://wisv.ch/fpcregistration) to complete your registration. Only after submitting the form, your team is registered for participating in the FPC.

Can't wait any longer to solve puzzles? Check out the [fpc teaser](https://chipcie.wisv.ch/fpc/teaser) to get a taste of what the contest will be like!
