Are you a freshmen and do you want to solve puzzles in a team with your friends?
Then the Freshmen Programming Contest is for you!

On the 4th of May, the annual Freshmen Programming Contest will be held.
The puzzles are suited for both beginners and experts, so don't be afraid to join!
This contest is a great opportunity for you to sharpen your programming and puzzling skills!

The event lasts approximately from 10:30 until 17:30. More details will be sent
when you register. Teams with non-freshmen members are able to join as space allows, but will be
assigned to the spectator pool, meaning they do not count towards the final ranking.

After getting your ticket [here](https://wisv.ch/fpc), you need to fill in the [registration form](https://wisv.ch/fpcregistration)
to complete your registration. All team members need to both get a ticket and fill in the registration form!
