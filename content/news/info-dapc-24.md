We are excited to host the Delft Algorithm Programming Contest for you! Hopefully, you are as excited as we are for a day full of programming and fun! This email will contain practical information about the day itself, the rules of the contest and any other information you might need. Please read it carefully.

The contest will take place on Saturday, the 21st of September in [Drebbelweg](https://map.tudelftcampus.nl/poi/education-building-35/) (Cornelis Drebbelweg 5, 2628 CM Delft). The schedule of the day can be found further down in this post.

Below, you will find the rules for the contest. Please read these carefully. Not adhering to these rules can result in the disqualification of your team.

- You are only allowed to work in teams of at most three people.
- You are **not** allowed to communicate with anyone outside of your team during the contest, except for the organization.
- You are **not** allowed to bring your own keyboard.
- You have 5 hours to solve as many problems as possible.
- Submitting solutions to problems happens through the DOMjudge interface. A manual on how to use DOMjudge can be found [here](https://www.domjudge.org/docs/manual/8.3/index.html).
- You will be assigned one PC per team in one of the two contest halls. You are not allowed to touch your computer or the problem set before the contest starts. On the PC, you will find code editors and a browser that only has access to programming language documentation and the DOMjudge interface. The PC will not have access to the internet. More information can be found on our [systems](https://chipcie.wisv.ch/systems) page.
- The use of other computers than the one provided is not allowed. This also includes mobile devices, smart watches, etc.
- You are allowed to bring physical reference materials, such as books, cheat sheets, etc. Be aware though that on the BAPC you are only allowed to bring a “Team Reference Document” (TRD) consisting out of a maximum of 25 A4 pages. We will provide pen and paper, but you are free to bring your own.

The CHipCie will be present the whole day. You can ask organizational or system questions to the people from the organization. They will be walking around the room. Any questions regarding the **problem set** during the contest will have to be asked to the jury through a clarification request within the DOMjudge interface.

We highly recommend going through the DOMjudge manual as a team. This way, everyone  knows how the interface functions and everyone is up to date with the technical guidelines of the contest.
Additionally, the BAPC jury has provided a website with advice, hints, and general advice at: [https://jury.bapc.eu/advice](https://jury.bapc.eu/advice)

The schedule of the day is as follows:

The drinks afterwards will be at X café; here you will also have the possibility to order food.

If there are any questions regarding this email or the contest, be sure to send us an email.<br>
We as CHipCie are excited to have you at the DAPC! Good luck in advance and most importantly: have fun!
