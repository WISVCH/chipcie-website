In 1992, the region was split in west and east,
which created the Western European Regional Contest (WERC).<br>
In 1994, the region was split again in north and south,
which created the North Western European Regional Collegiate Programming Contest (NWERCPC),
or from 1998, the Northwestern Europe Regional Contest (NWERC). ([source](/archive/1995/nwercpc/preface.jpg))<br>
